.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBoshrun\fP, a.k.a. \fBoshexec\fP, runs an OpenSHMEM program on the
given number of processing elements.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-n N | -np N" 4
Run the program on N processing elements (PEs or processors).
Overrides any PE count inherited from launch environment.
.LP
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.LP
If set, boolean flags are enabled with a non-zero numeric value, or
"y", "yes", or "on"; disabled with zero numeric value, or "n", "no",
or "off".
.LP
Controlling the launcher:
.LP
.RS 4
.IP "OSHRUN_DEBUG (bool, default: false)"
If set to true, oshrun outputs its progress of launching the
application to standard error.
.RE
.\"
.LP
OpenSHMEM environment variables are prefixed with "SHMEM_".
.LP
Some older SHMEM implementations had variables prefixed with "SMA_":
these are still supported in OpenSHMEM, but are deprecated.  If both
are set for a given variable, the "SHMEM_" one will be used.
.LP
.\"
.RS 4
.\"
.LP
Required by specification:
.RS 4
.IP "SHMEM_VERSION, SMA_VERSION (bool: default false)"
print library version at start-up
.IP "SHMEM_INFO, SMA_INFO (bool: default false)"
print information about supported environment variables
.IP "SHMEM_SYMMETRIC_SIZE, SMA_SYMMETRIC_SIZE (number: default @SHMEM_DEFAULT_HEAP_SIZE@)"
set the size of the symmetric heap.  Can use K,M,G,T units (2^10).
.IP "SHMEM_DEBUG, SMA_DEBUG (bool: default false)"
enable run debugging/sanity checking (if configured).
.RE
.LP
This implementation also has:
.RS 4
.IP "SHMEM_LOGGING (bool: default false)"
enable message logging (if configured).
.IP "SHMEM_LOGGING_EVENTS (string: default none)"
A comma-separated list of events that select logging messages (if
logging enabled, v.i.): fatal, init, finalize, memory, heaps,
contexts, info, reductions, barriers, deprecate, locks, atomics; or
"all", which selects all of the above.
.RE
.RS 4
.IP "SHMEM_LOGGING_FILE (string: default none)"
file to receive logging information.
.RE
.RS 4
.IP "SHMEM_BARRIER_ALGO (string: default tree)"
Algorithm name to use for barriers: currently one of "linear", "tree",
"dissem" (dissemination).
.RE
.RS 4
.IP "SHMEM_BROADCAST_ALGO (string: default tree)"
Algorithm name to use for broadcasts: currently one of "linear",
"tree", "dissem", "binomial", "binomial2".
.RE
.RS 4
.IP "SHMEM_PREALLOC_CTXS (integer: default 64)"
How many OpenSHMEM context slots to preallocate at startup.
.RE
.RS 4
.IP "SHMEM_LAUNCHER (default: search)"
Name of program to use for underlying launcher.  Default behavior is
to search for PRRTE or a PMIx-aware MPI launcher.  Can also be set by
configure.
.RE
.RS 4
.IP "SHMEM_PROGRESS_THREADS (default: unset)"
If we need extra progress for transports that don't provide it,
activate progress threads on the named PEs, e.g. "0", "1-3", "2,4,6";
or on all PEs if the variable's (case-insensitive) value is "y[es]" or
"a[ll]".
.RE
.RS 4
.IP "SHMEM_MEMERR_FATAL (bool, default: true)"
If set to true, symmetric memory corruption or overflow is treated as
a fatal condition, and the program exits.  If unset or false, the
issue will be logged (see SHMEM_LOGGING and
SHMEM_LOGGING_EVENTS=memory above), but the program will try to
continue.  (This will likely lead to undefined behavior.)

.SH EXAMPLES
The command
.LP
.RS 4
$ oshrun -np 4 ./sping.x -e 8192
.RE
.LP
runs the ping-pong code from
.RS 4
.LP
\f(CRhttps://github.com/openshmem-org/openshmem-examples\fP
.RE
.LP
on 4 processing elements, and passes the command-line arguments "-e"
and "8192" through to the OpenSHMEM program.
.SH NOTES
.LP
The OpenSHMEM specification does not say anything normative about how
OpenSHMEM programs are compiled, linked and launched.  These wrapper
programs are supplied as part of the Reference Library for
convenience.
